============

Some Anki2 add-ons in different states of usefulness and bugginess.

See [http://ospalh.github.com/anki-addons/](http://ospalh.github.com/anki-addons/) for a full list.

The more useful include:

## backdoor.py
Open a user profile with one specific password.

##Colorful toolbar.py
Give Anki2 a bit of the Anki1 look with a bunch of colorful command
buttons.

## Furigana mod.py
Some templates to modify the display of Japanese text

## Kanji stroke colour.py
My take on displaying coloured stroke order diagrams.
